<h1>Dijkstra helpers</h1>

<code>RandGraph</code> is a program to help with generating, converting and
manipulating graphs.

<h2>Installing</h2>
See <a href="INSTALL.html" >INSTALL</a>.


<h2>Using RandGraph</h2>

Run the program without args to get a list of available commands. A summary of what the various commands do:
<ul>
<li>Generate (in native Haskell format) random graphs with:
<ul><li>Specified number of vertices,
    <li>Normally distributed out-degree per vertex, but within a specified maximum. Thus, the out-degree distribution is a "truncated normal".
    <li>Uniformly random edge destinations (unique for a given source vertex),
    <li>Uniform edge weights, within a given range.
</ul>
<li> Compute shortest paths on the graphs.
<li>Convert graphs to:
<ul>
   <li>C-Json as needed by the SFDL program,
    <li>Stream of numbers in the format expected by the C implementation of Dijsktra (in <code>dijkstra/c/</code>) intended for the MIPS emulator.
  <li>A gviz file, which can be processed using <code>dot</code> to produce visualizations of the graph.
  <li>A file for the uDrawGraph visualization program. This is currently incomplete - the produced uDrawGraph image does not show vertex numbers or edge weights.
</ul>
<li> Convert graphs from:
<ul><li>C-Json format.
    <li>A "manual" format consisting of Haskell lists of edges, as specified by the input to the processing function:
<pre>
manual2gr :: [(Int,             -- ! vertex number
               [(Int,           -- ! edge destination vertex number
                 Int)           -- ! edge weight
               ])
             ] -> ...
</pre>
</ul>

</ul>
